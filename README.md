# Feistel fill screen

[Recently I've watched a video about Feistel networks and how they works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhHchcomjL0&t=227s)
(unfortunately it is only in italian, but I think english auto-translation should be accurate enough to understand the content),
and at a certain point the author has shown an interesting use case where he fills the console with 
asterisks at random positions without repeatitions. Leaving  the actual implementation of the algorithm as an exercise, I 
developed this solution in rust (even though C was used along the explaination),
so I can train my skills with this programming language
